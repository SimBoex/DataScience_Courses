# ADM course
It was the first exam where i had to work with teamates frequently.
Moreover, as frequently as 1 project each 2 weeks.
Here i learnt how to interact with people of different backgrounds and also how to manage better the stress involved in the process.
At the end of the course, there was a oral presentation of the projects with a discussion of them
